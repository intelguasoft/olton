## I'm Serhii Pimenov and I'm Web Developer

Hi! My name is Serhii Pimenov. I am a Web Developer from Kiyv, Ukraine, and I'm very passionate and dedicated to my work. With 20 years of experience as a programmer and over 10 years of experience as a professional Web Developer. I have acquired the skills and knowledge necessary to make your project a success. I enjoy every step of the design process, from discussion and collaboration to concept and execution, but I find the most satisfaction in seeing the finished product do everything for you that it was created to do. Now I specialized in creating web components with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
